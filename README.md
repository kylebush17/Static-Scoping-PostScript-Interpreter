# Static-Scoping-PostScript-Interpreter
This is a project that I worked on in my computer science curriculum at WSU. it is a postscript interpreter and for extra credit I took it one step 
further and made it able to use static or dynamic scoping. the code is all there, however i only have one test case in this particular project 
that will run while the code is compiled.
